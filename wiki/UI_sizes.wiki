#labels Phase-Implementation
This page points to rurple default window size and the "Code and learn" tab dimension links in the code.

= Introduction =
The purpose is to make it easy for developers and people not liking the default split or wanting to modify it to fit different screen sizes by default. All sizes are in pixel. Rurple currently loads at 800x660 (in svn) in order to support smaller screen but still avoid scrollbars.

We're working on a 10" netbook size (1024 x 600), but you could eventually play with the files below to fit a smaller resolution screen at startup without having scrollbars.

= Variables =
All values have been moved to rur_py/misc.py into SCREEN.
SCREEN=[800,660,290,57,34,6]
where	800 is rurple window size width at startup
	660 is rurple window size height at startup
	290 is the programming pane width in "code and learn" tab
	57 is the debugging window height at the lower right in "code and learn"
	34 is Reeborg's world brick length
	6 is Reeborg's world brick thickness

== Rur-ple size at startup ==
Defined in rur_start.py
 * line 110: size = (misc.SCREEN[0], misc.SCREEN[1])
 * line 171: self.SetSize((misc.SCREEN[0], misc.SCREEN[1])) <- this line overrides the former one

== World drawing size in pixel ==
Defined in world_creation.py
 * line 222: tile_info = (misc.SCREEN[4], misc.SCREEN[5])
 * beepers centering is defined below and adjusted based on above parameters
 * even a much smaller world doesn't really need adjusting the beeper settings

== Code and Learn windows split ==
Defined in sash.py
 * line 56: win.SetDefaultSize(wx.Size(misc.SCREEN[2], 600))
 * line 74: self.bottomWindow.SetDefaultSize(wx.Size(800, misc.SCREEN[3]))

== version 1.0.1 sizes ==
Current released version launches with:
 * screen size of 900 x 660
 * program code left pane of 300 (code and learn)
 * debug lower right pane of 100 (code and learn)
