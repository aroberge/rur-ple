This page points to rurple default window size and the "Code and learn" tab dimension links in the code.

= Introduction =
The purpose is to make it easy for developers and people not liking the default split or wanting to modify it to fit different screen sizes by default. All sizes are in pixel. Rurple currently loads at 800x660 (in svn) in order to support smaller screen but still avoid scrollbars.

We're working on a 10" netbook size (1024 x 600), but you could eventually play with the files below to fit a smaller resolution screen at startup without having scrollbars.


= Rur-ple size at startup =
Defined in rur_start.py
 * line 110: size = (800, 660)
 * line 171: self.SetSize((800, 660)) <- this line overrides the former one

= World drawing size in pixel =
Defined in world_creation.py
 * line 221: tile_info = (34, 6)  <- 34 is brick length, 6 the brick thickness
 * beepers centering is defined below and adjusted based on above parameters
 * even a much small world doesn't really need adjusting the beeper settings

= Code and Learn windows split =
Defined in sash.py
 * line 55: win.SetDefaultSize(wx.Size(290, 600)) <- 290 is the width of the program area (left pane)
 * line 73: self.bottomWindow.SetDefaultSize(wx.Size(800, 57)) <- 57 is the height of the debug window (right lower pane)

= version 1.0.1 sizes =
Current released version launches with:
 * screen size of 900 x 660
 * program code left pane of 300 (code and learn)
 * debug lower right pane of 100 (code and learn)
