#labels Phase-Implementation
This page points to rurple default window size and the "Code and learn" tab dimension links in the code.

= Introduction =
The purpose is to make it easy for developers and people not liking the default split or wanting to modify it to fit different screen sizes by default. All sizes are in pixel. Rurple currently loads at 800x660 (in svn) in order to support smaller screen but still avoid scrollbars.

We're working on a 10" netbook size (1024 x 600), but you could eventually play with the files below to fit a smaller resolution screen at startup without having scrollbars.

= Variables =
All values have been moved to the variable initialization section in rur_start.py and the variable is called SCREEN.

{{{misc.SCREEN=[800,660,290,57,34,6,13,12,9]}}}
where
 *	800 is rurple window size width at startup
 *	660 is rurple window size height at startup
 *	290 is the programming pane width in "code and learn" tab
 *	57 is the debugging window height at the lower right in "code and learn"
 *	34 is Reeborg's world brick length
 *	6 is Reeborg's world brick thickness
 *	13 is the beeper position offset
 *	12 is Reeborg's horizontal offset
 *	9 is Reeborg's vertical offset

Working values for 10" screen at 1024x600 seems to be {{{misc.SCREEN = [800,550,350,40,27,5,8,8,3]}}}.
