RUR-PLE is a Python desktop implementation of Pattis's "Karel the robot". 
I started this project in 2004 and learned much while working on it, incorporating suggestions from teachers.

It is now obsolete.

Reeborg's World (live on http://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html, repository at https://github.com/aroberge/reeborg, 
documentation link to be found at http://reeborg.ca) is a **much** improved version.
