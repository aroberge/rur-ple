<p>Nobody likes to talk about computer bugs. So, I will try to keep this lesson short. All I ask you to do is to read it I won't ask you to write programs
with bugs!</p>
<h3 class="section">What is a bug?</h3>
<p>The origin of the word <b>bug</b> in computer jargon is often attributed
to an actual incident where a moth was found inside Harvard University's Mark
II computer; apparently this moth had caused the computer to stop working. It
was found by the team headed by renowned computer scientist, mathematician,
and young naval officer Grace Murray Hopper, who went on to invent the
concept of compiler languages in computer programming. Dr. Grace Hopper
eventually rose in the U.S. naval hierarchy to the rank of Rear Admiral.</p>
<p>The moth was preserved, taped into Hopper's log book, as shown below.
Interestingly, the log book included a note saying, "First actual case of bug
being found." as you can see.</p>

<p>Actually, the word bug in a technological context is attributed by the
Oxford English Dictionary to Thomas Edison. According to the Oxford
Dictionary, the following text can apparently be found in the March 11, 1889
edition of the Pall Mall Gazette:</p>
<blockquote><cite>Mr. Edison, I was informed, had been up the two previous
nights discovering 'a bug' in his phonograph - an expression for solving a
difficulty, and implying that some imaginary insect has secreted itself
inside and is causing all the trouble.</cite></blockquote>
<p>It thus appears that the original 'bug', though it was indeed an insect,
was in fact imaginary.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, computer bugs, while they are not insects, are also not
imaginary.</p>
<h3 class="section">Dealing with bugs</h3>
<p>In computer jargon, a bug is an error that causes a program to behave in
an unexpected way. If you are writing computer programs, you are going to
have bugs in them sooner or later - everybody does. Good programmers seek to
"remove" bugs or "fix" them as soon as they find that their program behaves
unexpectedly.</p>
<p>RUR-PLE has been designed to help you find bugs.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The "oil leak" of the robot, leaves a trace behind that allows you to see
(<i>trace</i>) the instructions followed by the robot.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/intro/turn_left_end.png" alt="simple left turn"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each instruction [like <tt>pick_beeper()</tt> below] is highlighted
in the program window as it is about to be executed by the robot.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/intro/highlight.png" alt="highlighted instruction"/></p>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">Highlighting of instructions can sometimes cause
problems; you can turn it on and off by pressing the highlight
button.</font></b> <img src="../../images/intro/btn_highlight.png" alt="highlight button"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can "pause" a program as it is running by pressing the pause button
<img src="../../images/intro/btn_pause.png" alt="pause button"/>. This is similar to what people refer to as setting a
<i>breakpoint</i> in a computer program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can "step through" a program, one instruction at a time, by pressing
the (execute one instruction and pause, or <i>step</i>) button <img src=
"../../images/intro/btn_step.png" alt="step button"/>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can change the speed at which the instructions are executed by using
the speed controller <img src="../../images/intro/btn_speed.png" alt="speed button"/>. The more you move the slider to the right, the faster
the program will execute. You can only adjust the speed at the beginning of
the program, at which point it will be set for the entire program. For long
running program, you can first start running the program quickly, pause it
when you reach the point near the unexpected behaviour (the "bug"), and then
carefully step through each instruction one at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you started a program and find that you want to stop it before it
reaches the end, you can always press the stop button <img src=
"../../images/intro/btn_stop.png" alt="stop button"/>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is a status bar which displays: 1) which
program is loaded; 2) the status of that program; 3) the number of beepers
carried by the robot; 4) which world file has been loaded.<br/>
<img src="../../images/intro/status_bar.png" alt="status bar"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to restart your program with the robot back at its original
starting point when you first loaded a world file, you will need to press the reset world button
<img src="../../images/intro/btn_reset_world.png" alt="reset button"/>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This should be more than enough for now. As you learn more about
programming, you will learn other tricks that will help you find bugs and get
rid of them!</p>
