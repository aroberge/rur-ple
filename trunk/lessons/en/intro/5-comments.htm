<title>Any comments?</title>

<h2 class="title">5. Any comments? <i>Avez-vous des
commentaires?</i></h2>

<p>Open the first program that you have written. You did save it and keep it
as I asked you to, didn't you? If not, rewrite it while I wait for you.</p>

<p>Ok, your program should now be displayed in the program window. Now,
remember what I told you was the most important thing to do when writing a
computer program? If not, go back to the very beginning and read again.</p>

<p>I'm waiting ...</p>

<p>Got it? Right, the most important thing to do is to make it easy for other
people to read your program. This takes a lot of practice and usually
requires a fair bit of thinking. However, we can use a trick of writing notes
meant for other humans only (and not for the computer) inside the program. We
call these notes <em>comments</em>. There are a few ways to write comments in
a program. I'm going to teach you the simplest way used in Python. Add the
following text as the first line of your program:</p>

<pre>
# My first program
</pre>

<p>So that it should now look like the following:</p>

<pre>
<span class="comment"># My first program</span>
move()
move()
turn_off()
</pre>

<p>If you are not colour blind, you will see that the line which begins with
the symbol <tt><span class="comment">#</span></tt>, appears in green. This
symbol indicates that the rest of the line is a <em>comment</em> which is
ignored by Reeborg (or Python). Having the text for comments shown in green
helps us distinguish comments from instructions. There is no special reason
for the colour choice; I just chose to write RUR-PLE so that it would appear
like that.</p>

<h3 class="try">Your turn</h3>

<p>What happens if you put the symbol # at the beginning of a <b>command</b>
line? Try it, save the resulting program and run it by clicking on the
<img alt="run program button" src="../../images/intro/btn_run.png" /> button to
see what Reeborg makes of it.</p>

<h3 class="section">Teaching Reeborg some French</h3>

<p>While the creators of Reeborg designed him so that he obeys instructions
in English, they realised that not everyone understands English. So, they
gave him the ability to easily learn a second language. For example, if we
want to tell someone to "move forward" in French, we would say "avance". We
can tell Reeborg that "avance" is a synonym of "move" simply by writing<br />
<tt>avance = move</tt>.<br />
The order here is important; the known command has to be on the right, and
the new one has to be on the left. Note that we don't have any parentheses
"<tt>()</tt>" appearing since the parentheses would tell Reeborg that we want
him to obey an instruction; here, we are simply teaching him a new word. When
we want Reeborg to follow the new instruction, we will use
<tt>avance()</tt>.</p>

<h3 class="try">Your turn</h3>

<p>Write a program with the following instructions:</p>

<pre>
avance = move
avance()
turn_off()
</pre>

<p>and save it under "avance.rur". Now, try your new program.</p>

<h3 class="suggested">Experiment!</h3>

<p>If you want, you can also teach Reeborg a synonym for <tt>turn_off</tt>.
Or, you may give synonyms in a language other than French if you prefer, even
creating your own language. Then, watch Reeborg as he obeys instructions
written in <em>your</em> language.</p>
