<h2 class="title">3. First program</h2>

<p>As mentioned previously, there are two main windows used to interact with
Reeborg. To the left is a program window; this is where you write the
instructions for Reeborg to follow. To the right is the actual "graphical
world" window in which Reeborg moves according to the instructions
received.</p>

<p>Click on the Open Program button <img alt="open program button" src=
"../../images/intro/btn_open_program.png" /> and select the file "move1.rur".
(<span class="warning">Note:</span> dependings on the settings on your
computer, you may or may not see the ".rur" extension.) You should see the
following <em>computer code</em>, or <em>code</em> for short, appear in the
program window.</p>

<pre>
move()
turn_off()
</pre>

<p>The word <em>code</em> is synonymous with "program text". A
<em>program</em> is a series of <em>instructions</em>. In this case, the code
consists of two <em>instructions</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>move()</tt>: instructs Reeborg to move forward one "step".<br/></li>
<li><tt>turn_off()</tt>: tells Reeborg that we have no more instructions to
give him and that he can turn itself off, to save energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reeborg recognizes instructions as commands that he must obey by the
presence of two parentheses <tt>()</tt> which follow the words making up the
instructions.</p>

<p>Now, click on the <img alt="run program button" src=
"../../images/intro/btn_run.png" /> button and watch Reeborg move in his
world.</p>

<h3 class="try">Your turn</h3>

<p>Change the program by adding a second <tt>move()</tt> instruction as
follows:</p>

<pre>
move()
move()
turn_off()
</pre>

<p>Click on the Save button <img alt="save program button" src=
"../../images/intro/btn_save_program.png" /> and give it the name "move2" (the
program will automatically add the ".rur" extension). Congratulations! You
have just created your first program. Now, ask Reeborg to <em>execute</em> or
to <em>run</em> the program by clicking on the <img alt="run program button"
src="../../images/intro/btn_run.png" /> button.</p>

<h3 class="suggested">Experiment!</h3>

<p>You can ask Reeborg to take more than two steps. What happens if you ask
Reeborg to take so many steps that he has to move beyond the world boundary?
In particular, look at the program window; you should have noticed by now
that instructions are highlighted as they are being executed by Reeborg.</p>
