<h2 class="title">6. Making a left turn.</h2>
<p>As we have mentioned before, Reeborg can turn in any direction ...
provided it is to his left, and by 90 degrees at that. This is because his
creators were too cheap to implement a better steering mechanism. To ask
Reeborg to turn left you write ... <tt>turn_left()</tt>!</p>
<p>For example, if Reeborg is starting from his usual initial position, this
simple program</p>
<pre>
move()
turn_left()
move()
turn_off()
</pre>
<p>will give rise to the following display.</p>
<img alt="simple left turn" src="../../images/intro/turn_left_end.png"/>
<h3 class="try">Your turn</h3>
<p>Have Reeborg trace a simple square, using the following program:</p>
<pre>
move()
turn_left()
move()
turn_left()
move()
turn_left()
move()
turn_left()
turn_off()
</pre>
<p>Remember that you must save your program before you can use it. <b>Try
it!</b></p>
<p>Note that, if English is not your favourite language, you can always
create a synonym in your language, as long as you define it first, before
using it. However, the synonym you introduce must use the English alphabet
(letters without any accents). For example, in French, one might
<b>define</b> <tt>vire_a_gauche = turn_left</tt> and <b>use</b>
<tt>vire_a_gauche()</tt> to instruct the robot to turn left.</p>
<h3 class="try">Your turn again!</h3>
<p>Write a program that will make Reeborg turn counterclockwise around a
square, taking 2 steps forward then turning left and repeating until he is
back at his starting point facing east, his original direction, as
illustrated below.</p>

<p>Feel free to try to write other programs to make Reeborg move along
various paths in his world.</p>

<h3 class="section">Going home</h3>
<p>When you enter Reeborg's world, Reeborg is usually standing on the corner
of the first avenue and the first street, facing East. Click on the
"Show/Hide world file" button <img alt="Show/Hide world file" src=
"../../images/intro/btn_show_world_file.png"/>, which is on the right side.
You will see the display below change, with some text appearing on the right
hand side. In particular, note the line that says <tt>robot = (1, 1, 'E',
0)</tt>. This indicates the position of Reeborg in his world. The first
number is the avenue on which Reeborg is standing, the second is the street,
and the letter between the quotes indicates the direction that Reeborg is
facing (E = East, N = North, W = West, S = South), East being facing right,
North facing up, etc.. The fourth number (0) is the number of
<em>beepers</em> that Reeborg carries; we will learn about beepers a bit
later.</p>
<p>As you have seen before, you can make Reeborg move by using the up and
left arrow keys on your computer keyboard. When you so move Reeborg, he
doesn't leave any trace of his movements. You should notice however that the
text between the parentheses in <tt>robot = (...)</tt> changes as Reeborg
moves, to reflect his new position in his world.</p>
<h3 class="try">Your turn</h3>
<p>Using the keyboard, move Reeborg until he is standing at the corner of the
third avenue and the fourth street, facing South, as indicated below. Then,
write a program that will make Reeborg start from this new position and go
back to the corner of the first avenue and the first street, facing East as
indicated below. Try to have Reeborg take fewer steps and turns to do this
than we have shown below.</p>
