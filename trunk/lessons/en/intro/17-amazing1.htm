<h2 class="title">17. Amazing - part 1</h2>
<p>In this multi-part lesson, we are going to write a complete program to
solve problems of increasing complexity.</p>
<!--===================================================-->

<h3 class="section">Amazing solution: first steps</h3>
<p>Let us start by considering a simple problem: having Reeborg go around his
world once, assuming there is no obstacle on the way. We have done this
before, when we introduced the <tt>front_is_clear()</tt> test. Here's the
outline of a solution which supposes that Reeborg carries at least one beeper
at the beginning:</p>
<pre>
1. Put down a beeper to mark the starting point.
2. Move forward until facing a wall.
3. Turn left when facing a wall.
4. Repeat steps 2. and 3. until we find the beeper we had put down.
5. Turn off when finding the beeper.
</pre>
<p>The key step is 4, where we have a repeating instruction with a test. This
instruction can be written as:</p>
<pre>
<span class="keyword">while not</span> on_beeper():
</pre>
<p>following which should be steps 2 and 3 Let's now translate the entire
solution in proper code:</p>
<pre>
put_beeper()
<span class="keyword">while not</span> on_beeper():
    <span class="keyword">if</span> front_is_clear():
        move()
    <span class="keyword">else</span>:
        turn_left()

turn_off()
</pre>
<p>Take the time to think about what the above program instructs Reeborg to
do, if the starting position is the one illustrated below:</p>
<p><img alt="around the world: start" src=
"../../images/intro/around1start.png"/></p>
<p>We did not get the desired result, which is indicated below. Did you
figure out why? If not, go back and think about it.</p>

"../../images/intro/around1end.png"/></p>
