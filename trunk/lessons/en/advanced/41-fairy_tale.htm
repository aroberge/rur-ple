<h2 class="title">41. A Robotic Fairy Tale</h2>

<p>A long, long time ago... in a faraway land ...<br />
Are you brave enough to accept the challenge of writing function definitions that will make the following story come to life, and reproduce the final scene illustrated below?<br />
<i>Hint:</i> my solution requires only five Python keywords: 
<span class="pykeyword">def</span>, <span class="pykeyword">while</span>,
<span class="pykeyword">for</span>, <span class="pykeyword">in</span>, and <span class="pykeyword">global</span>.  You can do it of course without using
some of these keywords, but your program will be longer.</p>

His heart did the same when a fearless Warrior, 
named Anna, appeared seemingly out of nowhere.
She had come investigate news that

<h3 class='section'>For further reading</h3>

<p>At this point in your Python learning journey, you might be ready to read other, more advanced material. If you feel brave, here are two suggestions which are perhaps a bit advanced but are two of my favourite Python books:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Python in a Nutshell</i>, written by Alex Martelli, who is famous, amongst other things, for his many contributions on comp.lang.python.  His <b>many</b> insightful messages have contributed to him being known as "the martellibot".  (Other famous "bots" are "the timbot" and "the effbot".  For many years, rumours were floating that no humans could write so many messages so quickly; they had to share some characteristics with robots.)</li>
<li>Alex has also been a co-author of both the first and the second editions of the <i>Python Cookbook</i>, which I also recommend heartily.  David Ascher has been co-author of both editions of the <i>Python Cookbook</i>.  Anna Martelli Ravenscroft, Alex's wife, is a co-author of the second edition.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="warning">Disclaimer</h3>

<p>Any resemblance between RobotLand's Scholar Alex and the Warrior Anna,
and any real-life individuals is purely coincidental.</p>
