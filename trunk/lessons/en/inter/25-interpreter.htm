<h2 class="title">25. Python already knows how to add.</h2>
<p>In the last lesson, we saw how complicated it was to try and teach
Reeborg to add two numbers. In this lesson, we will see how easy it is to get
to add numbers using the Python language... and do other mathematical operations.</p> 
<!--==============================-->
<hr width="50%"/>
<h3 class="section">First things first</h3>
<p>Select the Python interpreter (Python: Code and Learn), by clicking on the
third tab. Your display should look something like the following (other than
having French used as the default language for the GUI):</p>
<p><img alt="Python interpreter" src=
"../../images/inter/interpreter.png"/></p>
<br/>
<p>Ignore the first two lines of the display for now. On the third line is
the Python <i>prompt</i></p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p>Now, let's see if we can make Python add two numbers more easily than
Reeborg could. Put the cursor on line 3, click to select it and type "Add 8
and 4" followed by the "enter" key. Python will reply, in its own language,
in what may appears as some insults!</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Add 8 <span class="keyword">and</span> 4
  File <span class="string">"&lt;input&gt;"</span>, line 1
    Add 8 <span class="keyword">and</span> 4
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p>So, the Python interpreter does not understand commands written in
English. However, you should note that it does recognize Python keywords like
<span class="pykeyword">and</span> as it displays them in a different color
than the rest of the text (different also from the color we have chosen, but
that is not important.)</p>
<p>Note that it is <u>prompt</u>ing you again for some new input. This time,
try something simpler like typing "8+4" followed by the "enter" key. You
should see something like this on the display:</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 8+4
12
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
<p>Success! Python added the two numbers right away (which was so difficult
to get Reeborg to do). It's even prompting you again to give it more
instructions. You can try something like the following, which I have copied
from the interpreter to here.</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 8+4
12
&gt;&gt;&gt; 8-4
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; 8*4
32
&gt;&gt;&gt; 8/4
2
</pre>
<p>As you can see, Python knows how to add, subtract, multiply and
divide.</p>
<h3 class="section">More numbers</h3>
<p>Python knows about the <i>order of precedence</i> of mathematical
operators. By this we mean that, when you have many numbers and mathematical
operations, you multiply and divide numbers first (from left to right), then
add and subtract, etc. Here, a few examples are probably a better explanation
than words could provide on their own.</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+3*5
17
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+ (3*5)   <span class=
"comment"># Python does not care about spaces here</span>
17
&gt;&gt;&gt; (2+3)*5
25
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2*4/8
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+1-4
-1
</pre>
<p>Go ahead, try some more examples on your own! See, if you can come up with
any surprising result.</p>
<!--==============================-->
<hr width="50%"/>
<h3 class="section">Surprising division</h3>
<p>If you haven't found any surprising result, it's because you haven't tried
many examples. For example, try <tt>7/3</tt>. Can you make sense of the
result? Try also <tt>1/2</tt>.</p>
<!--==============================-->
<hr width="50%"/>
<h3 class="section">Integer division</h3>
<p>Python recognizes different types of numbers. The simplest type are the
integers (or whole numbers). When Python divides an integer by another
integer, it throws away any remainder to give us a whole number (integer) as
the answer. Thus, when we divide 7 by 3 it gives us 2 (with a remainder of
1). To get the remainder part, we use the <tt>%</tt> symbol:</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 7/3
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; 7%3
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1/2
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1%2
1
</pre>
<p>To get the result we would normally expect, we need to tell Python to use
real numbers or <i>floats</i>. We do that by adding a decimal period ("dot")
at the end of at least one of the numbers.</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1./2
0.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1/2.
0.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.00000/2
0.5
</pre>
<h3 class="section">More mathematical operations</h3>
<p>Python knows more than the basic mathematical operations. Here are a few
more examples for you to try to expand on.</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3*3*3*3
81
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3**4  <span class="comment"># exponentiation</span>
81
&gt;&gt;&gt; 7.3 % 3  <span class="comment"># remainder, again</span>
1.2999999999999998
</pre>
<p>This last result is <i>almost</i> equal to 1.3 which is what we might have
expected. The difference between 1.3 and 1.2999999999999998 is tiny ... and
is caused by the way computers work with decimal fractions. I will explain
how this comes about in a later lesson, when you know more about computer
programming in general. Just note that, in practice, such small difference
between the "exact" result and that given by Python (or any other computer
language) should not matter. Note however that Python can be made to display
the result in a more sensible way; try the following:</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="keyword">print</span> 7.3 % 3
1.3
</pre>
<p>The <span class="pykeyword">print</span> keyword instructs Python to show
us the result of the calculation, and it does so "intelligently". Sometimes,
Python will perform some computations without displaying the result. By using
the <span class="pykeyword">print</span> keyword, we can instruct Python to
display a result that might not have been shown otherwise.</p>
<p>Are you curious? What happens if you put a <span class=
"pykeyword">print</span> instruction in one of Reeborg's programs?...</p>
<h3 class="section">Large numbers</h3>
<p>Try the following:</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2147483647 + 1
2147483648L
</pre>
<p>Look carefully: do you notice the curious "L" at the end of the answer?
This is to denote what is known as a <i>Long</i> integer, that is to say an
integer which can not be easily handled by the CPU. For a
computer with a so-called 32-bit chip, as an example, all positive numbers are represented by various combinations of 32
"bits", and the largest integer that can be thus represented is <img alt=
"2^31" src="../../images/inter/2_31.png"/>-1 = 2147483647. 
<!--  wxHtml does not support the <sup> tag  -->
Any integer larger than this requires Python (or any other computer language)
to use advanced technique to perform mathematical operations on these
numbers. This slows down computations; Python reminds us of this by tagging
the letter L at the end. Unless you really need it, try to avoid using
extremely large numbers!</p>
<!--==============================-->
<hr width="50%"/>
<h3 class="section">1,000 is not a large number</h3>
<p>Try the following:</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1,000
(1, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1,000,000,000
(1, 0, 0, 0)
</pre>
<p>What is going on? All I will say for now is that you should not put commas
in numbers to separate thousands, like it is often done in many
english-speaking coutries. We will see later what commas mean to Python. In the meantime, we can see what commmas mean when we put them in a <span class="pykeyword">print</span> statement:</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="keyword">print</span> 5,4
5 4
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="keyword">print</span> 5,              4
5 4
</pre>
<p>Python takes the comma between the two numbers above to mean "put a single space between the two numbers (and ignore any other extra spaces) when you print them out.</p>
<!--==============================-->
<hr width="50%"/>
<h3 class="section">Scientific notation</h3>
<p>You are perhaps familiar with the scientific notation:</p>
<p><img alt="scientific notation" src="../../images/inter/sci_not.png"/></p>
<p>If so, you know that this notation allows us to write extremely small or
extremely large numbers in a very convenient way. [<small>If you don't know
about the scientific notation, you can skip this section as we will not make
use of it.</small>] Python also knows the scientific notation but uses the
letter E (or e) to represent <tt>x 10</tt></p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2e3
2000.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.5E-1
0.25
</pre>
<p>Try it!</p>
<!--==============================-->
<hr width="50%"/>
<h3 class="section">Other types of numbers</h3>
<p>Python also knows how to manipulate <i>complex numbers</i> as well as
<i>octal</i> (base 8) and <i>hexadecimal</i> (base 16) numbers. Do not worry
if you don't know what these are. The only ones we will need to use are the
hexadecimal numbers and we will explain what they are later.</p>
<!--==============================-->
<hr width="50%"/>
<h3 class="section">Comparing numbers</h3>
<p>Python knows how to compare numbers and decide if one is <i>smaller
than</i> (<tt>&lt;</tt>) the other, if it is <i>greater than</i>
(<tt>&gt;</tt>) the other, if they are equal (<tt>==</tt>) or if they are not
equal (<tt>!=</tt>).</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1&lt;2
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3&lt;2
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1&gt;2
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3&gt;2
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2==2
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3==2
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2!=2
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3!=2
True
</pre>
<p>Try it! Make sure to note the use of two equal signs when we want to check
if two numbers are equal. If you use a single equal sign, Python will
complain in its own way. [There are two other comparison operators:
<tt>&lt;=, &gt;=</tt>. You can try them and guess what they might
mean.]</p>
