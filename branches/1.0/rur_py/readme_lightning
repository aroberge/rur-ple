Lightning Compiler (LC) is a simple wxPython based editor designed for testing 
code snippets.  It includes an embedded Python shell.

LC is a single module (lightning.py) that can be run entirely on its own.
It can also be embedded in other apps; an example is given with 
test_import_lightning.py.

LC includes the ability to run doctests with, or without external test files.
A sample file (toy_test.py) with additional tests (toy_test.txt) is included
in this package.
